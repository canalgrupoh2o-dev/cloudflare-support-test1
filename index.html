          <p><strong>Description:</strong> "I've just added a Worker on the Cloudflare Dashboard for my website: it
            works in the debugger but doesn't work when I query the site. Why is that? Is there anything to activate or

            to a different page. It seems this is not possible with Cloudflare Page Rules. Is there any other way to
            achieve that using Cloudflare?"</p>
